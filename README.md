# Sales-Insights-Atliq Hardware

## Problem statement

- AtliQ Hardware, a major computer hardware and peripherals company in India and US, is facing challenges in understanding its sales performance, which has been declining lately.
- When contacted for updates, regional managers tend to present the information in an overly optimistic portrayal rather than providing an accurate assessment of the situation.
-  This makes it hard for the director to make sense of the data and make good decisions.
-   It's clear that the company needs better communication to figure out why sales are dropping and come up with effective solutions for improvement.

## Solution
- Sales director of the AltiQ hardware, decided to build a Tableau Dashboard for converting the data into visual representation to make data driven decisions.
- Just to be double sure of the insights derived using tableau ,SQL has been used to take a quick look over the data.

**2. Stakeholders**
- Which teams or Who from the company will be involved?
- In our Atliq case the following teams will be involved
  * Sales Director
  * Marketing Team
  * Customer Service Team
  * Data and Analytics Team 
  * IT Team

**3. End Result**
- After the project is over what do we want to achieve? Defining the end result clearly is very important.
-  It can never be blurry statements like -I want to increase sales insight. Instead a solid platform where the result can be projected.
- In our case, this will be a Tableau Dashboard which is automated and provides sales insights which are quick and latest thereby data driven decision making can be implemented. This will help the sales director and regional managers to look into real time information on the sales numbers.
